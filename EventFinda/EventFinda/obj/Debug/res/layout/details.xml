Tickets for the extra week will go on sale to the public at 5pm today Friday, 17 April. This will include eight performances from Tuesday, 19 May through to Sunday, 24 May, with no additional extensions possible. Singin' In The Rain opened in Wellington this week to thunderous applause -- turning Wellington’s historic St James Theatre into a “splash palace” until Sunday, 26 April. From the producers of Jersey Boys, The Sound of Music and Annie, comes another critically acclaimed production from London’s West End – the ever-popular musical Singin' In The Rain. Set in 1929 when silent movies were about to burst into sound, heartthrob Don Lockwood and silver screen beauty Lina Lamont are the power couple of Tinseltown. Or so fans are led to believe. In truth, Don barely tolerates his vapid leading lady who is convinced their screen romance is real. While trying to escape his eager fans (and Lina), Don has a chance encounter with aspiring actress Kathy Selden and falls in love. Despite his new interest, Don continues the pretence and makes his first talkie with Lina. The Dueling Cavalier is beset with difficulties, by far the worst being Lina's comically grating voice. A disastrous test screening forces Don and his best friend Cosmo Brown hatch a plan to relieve audiences of Lina's shrill. They'll dub Kathy's beautiful voice over Lina's to save the film. When Lina finds out, she is furious and does everything possible to sabotage Don and Kathy's romance. She maliciously demands that Kathy continue to provide her voice in all future films, but remain uncredited. Lina's plan backfires when she decides to give a speech at a film screening and the audience begs her to sing. Singin in the Rain -- starring Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds -- is now frequently described as one of the best musicals ever made. It topped the AFI's 100 Years of Musicals list, and is ranked as the fifth greatest American motion picture of all time in its updated list of the greatest American films in 2007.  This spectacular stage production is packed full of the charm, romance, comedy and features all the songs from the glorious MGM score including Good Morning, Make ‘em Laugh, Moses Supposes and the classic Singin’ in the Rain. The movie’s iconic choreography is flawlessly recreated, and with the help of 12,000 litres of water, the audience can enjoy one of the most famous dance routines live on stage, with some leaving the theatre a little wetter than when they arrived! To achieve the famous Singin’ In The Rain scene, the production uses half a mile of flexible pipe work, a 10 tonne water tank and a water system that creates a downpour from above as well as flooding from below the stage, in total ‘raining’ (and recycling) over 12,000 litres of water per performance.  Leading the cast of 27 is musical star Bethany Dickson, who recently took New Zealand by storm with her performance as Maria in The Sound of Music, and now returns to the stage as the wannabe actress Kathy. Making his debut in New Zealand as the charming Don Lockwood, is Grant Almirall, a seasoned star of musicals who recently triumphed in the role of Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys. With high-energy choreography, sumptuous set design and costumes, a superb score and a joyous story, Singin' In The Rain showers you with everything you could wish for in a hit musical." android:layout_width="match_parent" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:id="@+id/textView4" android:scrollbars="vertical" /></LinearLayout>
